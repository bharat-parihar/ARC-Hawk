# Shared Libraries

This directory contains shared code and contracts used across the monorepo.

## Structure

- **`api-contracts/`** - Shared API types and interfaces
- **`common/`** - Common utilities and helpers

## Usage

These libraries can be imported by scanner, backend, and frontend applications to ensure consistency.

## Future Plans

- Shared TypeScript/Go type definitions for API contracts
- Common validation logic
- Shared compliance models (GDPR, DPDPA, etc.)
