## Current Limitations

### 1. PII Type Coverage

**Limitation**: Only 11 India-specific PII types are supported

**Details**:
- **Locked PII Types**: IN_AADHAAR, IN_PAN, IN_PASSPORT, IN_VOTER_ID, IN_DRIVING_LICENSE, IN_PHONE, IN_UPI, IN_IFSC, IN_BANK_ACCOUNT, CREDIT_CARD, EMAIL_ADDRESS
- **Not Supported**: US SSN, UK NHS, EU GDPR identifiers, other international PII types
- **Impact**: Cannot be used for multi-region compliance without extension

**Workaround**:
- Add custom recognizers in scanner SDK
- Extend `pii_scope.py` to include additional types
- Update validation pipeline

**Future Enhancement**: 
- Modular PII type system
- Region-specific PII packs (US, EU, UK, etc.)
- User-configurable PII types

---

### 2. Language Support

**Limitation**: English language only

**Details**:
- **NLP Model**: `en_core_web_sm` (English small model)
- **Not Supported**: Hindi, regional Indian languages, other languages
- **Impact**: Cannot detect PII in non-English text

**Workaround**:
- Use language-specific NLP models (e.g., `hi_core_news_sm` for Hindi)
- Requires custom recognizer implementation

**Future Enhancement**:
- Multi-language support
- Language detection
- Automatic model selection based on detected language

---

### 3. Authentication & Authorization

**Limitation**: No authentication or authorization

**Details**:
- **Current State**: All API endpoints are publicly accessible
- **Security Risk**: Anyone with network access can view/modify data
- **Impact**: Not suitable for multi-tenant or public deployments

**Workaround**:
- Deploy behind VPN or firewall
- Use network-level access controls

**Future Enhancement**:
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API key management
- OAuth 2.0 integration
- Multi-tenancy support

---

### 4. Real-Time Scanning

**Limitation**: Batch scanning only (no real-time monitoring)

**Details**:
- **Current Workflow**: Manual scan execution → ingestion → visualization
- **Not Supported**: Continuous monitoring, file system watchers, database triggers
- **Impact**: Cannot detect PII in real-time as data is created

**Workaround**:
- Schedule periodic scans (cron jobs)
- Trigger scans via CI/CD pipelines

**Future Enhancement**:
- File system watchers (inotify, FSEvents)
- Database change data capture (CDC)
- Stream processing (Kafka, Kinesis)
- Real-time alerting

---

### 5. Data Masking

**Limitation**: Masking module is not fully implemented

**Details**:

- Format-preserving encryption (FPE)
- Masking policy engine
- Integration with data pipelines

---

### 6. Compliance Frameworks

**Limitation**: Only DPDPA 2023 (India) compliance mapping

**Details**:
- **Supported**: DPDPA 2023 categories and consent requirements
- **Not Supported**: GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, SOC 2, ISO 27001
- **Impact**: Limited use for global compliance

**Workaround**:
- Manual mapping to other frameworks
- Custom classification categories

**Future Enhancement**:
- Multi-framework support (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA)
- Framework-specific reporting
- Compliance score calculation
- Audit trail generation

---

### 7. Scalability Limits

**Limitation**: Performance degrades with very large datasets

**Details**:
- **Tested Limits**:
  - Assets: 1M (performance starts degrading)
  - Findings: 10M (query latency increases)
  - Neo4j nodes: 500K (graph queries slow down)
- **Bottlenecks**:
  - Neo4j synchronization is synchronous (blocks ingestion)
  - Large graph queries can timeout
  - Frontend struggles with >1000 nodes in lineage graph

**Workaround**:
- Pagination for large result sets
- Async Neo4j sync (already implemented)
- Graph filtering and sampling

**Future Enhancement**:
- Distributed scanning
- Sharded databases
- Graph database clustering
- Incremental graph updates
- Frontend virtualization for large graphs

---

### 8. OCR Accuracy

**Limitation**: OCR for images and PDFs has variable accuracy

**Details**:
- **Current Approach**: Basic OCR using Tesseract (in scanner)
- **Accuracy**: 70-90% depending on image quality
- **Impact**: May miss PII in scanned documents or low-quality images

**Workaround**:
- Pre-process images (contrast enhancement, noise reduction)
- Manual review of OCR results

**Future Enhancement**:
- Advanced OCR engines (Google Vision, AWS Textract)
- ML-based text extraction
- Confidence scoring for OCR results
- Human-in-the-loop review for low-confidence extractions

---

### 9. False Positive Rate

**Limitation**: Some false positives in PII detection

**Details**:
- **Common False Positives**:
  - Phone numbers: Test data (e.g., 9999999999)
  - Credit cards: Sequential numbers that pass Luhn
  - Emails: Auto-generated test emails
- **Impact**: Noise in findings, manual review required

**Workaround**:
- Dummy detector (filters common test patterns)
- Manual review and marking as false positive

**Future Enhancement**:
- ML-based false positive detection
- Context-aware validation (e.g., "test" keyword nearby)
- User feedback loop to improve detection
- Confidence thresholds with auto-filtering

---

### 10. Data Lineage Depth

**Limitation**: 3-level hierarchy may be insufficient for complex lineages

**Details**:
- **Current Model**: System → Asset → PII_Category
- **Not Supported**: 
  - Column-level lineage within tables
  - Transformation lineage (ETL pipelines)
  - Cross-system data flows
- **Impact**: Cannot track PII through complex data pipelines

**Workaround**:
- Manual documentation of data flows
- External lineage tools

- Column-level lineage
- Transformation tracking (ETL, data pipelines)
- Cross-system lineage (OpenLineage integration)
- Temporal lineage (track changes over time)
- Impact analysis (what-if scenarios)

---

## Performance Bottlenecks

### 1. Neo4j Synchronization

**Issue**: Synchronous Neo4j sync blocks ingestion

**Impact**:

- Batch processing

**Future Optimization**:
- Message queue for async sync (RabbitMQ, Kafka)
- Incremental sync (only changed assets)
- Parallel sync workers

---

### 2. Large Scan Ingestion

**Issue**: Ingesting scans with >100K findings is slow

**Impact**:
- API timeout (>15s)
- Memory pressure on backend

**Current Mitigation**:
- Batch processing (1000 findings per batch)
- Transaction batching

**Future Optimization**:
- Streaming ingestion
- Chunked uploads
- Background processing with progress tracking

---

### 3. Graph Query Performance

**Issue**: Complex graph queries (>3 levels) are slow

**Impact**:
- Lineage API latency >500ms for large graphs
- Frontend rendering delays

**Current Mitigation**:
- 3-level hierarchy (simplified from 4-level)
- Indexed properties

**Future Optimization**:
- Graph query caching
- Materialized views
- Query optimization (Cypher profiling)
- Graph sampling for large datasets

---

### 4. Frontend Rendering

**Issue**: Rendering >1000 nodes in lineage graph is slow

**Impact**:

**Current Mitigation**:
- Pagination
- Filtering by risk level or system

**Future Optimization**:
- Virtual scrolling
- Progressive rendering
- Graph clustering (aggregate nodes)
- WebGL-based rendering

## Known Issues

### 1. Duplicate Findings

**Issue**: Occasional duplicate findings across scans

**Root Cause**: Race condition in asset deduplication

**Impact**: Inflated finding counts

**Fix**: Implement distributed locking or unique constraints

---

### 2. Neo4j Connection Timeouts

**Issue**: Neo4j connection timeouts during heavy load

**Root Cause**: Connection pool exhaustion

**Impact**: Lineage sync failures

**Status**: Mitigated with connection pool tuning

**Fix**: Implement connection retry logic with exponential backoff

---

### 3. Scanner Memory Leaks

**Issue**: Scanner memory usage grows over time for very long scans

**Root Cause**: NLP model caching

**Impact**: Scanner crashes on large datasets
