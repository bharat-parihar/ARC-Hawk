# Docker Infrastructure

This directory contains shared Docker configurations and base images.

## Structure

- The root `docker-compose.yml` orchestrates the local development environment.
- Individual `Dockerfile`s are located within each application's directory:
  - `apps/scanner/Dockerfile`
  - `apps/backend/Dockerfile` (to be created)
  - `apps/frontend/Dockerfile` (to be created)
